## üß† Thought Process

1. **Component Structure**:
   - Form Component
   - ID Card Preview Component
   - Template Switcher
   - Saved Cards View

2. **State Management**:
   - Used React's `useState` and `useEffect` for state control.
   - Student data stored in state, then synced with localStorage.

3. **Image & QR Handling**:
   - Used `FileReader` for image previews.
   - `qrcode.react` encodes the JSON data from the form into a QR code.

4. **Exporting to PNG**:
   - Used `html-to-image` to convert the card into a downloadable PNG.

5. **Responsive Design**:
   - Tailwind CSS ensured quick styling and responsiveness across devices.
